# Personal data management

## Description

In this tab, first of all, you will find the list of modules installed on your store that are GDPR compliant.

If you consider that one or several modules collect personal data and that they donâ€™t appear on this list:

* Please make sure that you have access to the latest version of these modules to fully benefit the GDPR update.
* If they are still not displayed in the list, we invite you to contact their respective developers to have more information about these modules. Next, you can search for a customer in your database and view all of this customer's data that has been collected by the PrestaShop solution and the GDPR-compliant modules installed on your store. To search for a customer, please enter the first letters of your customer's name or email address.
