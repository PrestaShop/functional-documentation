# Pages not found (pagesnotfound)

This feature is available together with the Prestashop module. Once the module is Enabled, these functionalities will be seen.

If this module is Enabled, the statistical information will be retrieved and gathered in back-office Stats page in back-office.

If the page visitor mistype the URL, or the links are somehow expired, the visit will end with 404 response from the browser and the visitor will see the Page Not Found page in the front-office.

## Main components in front-office

The UI remains almost the same, as in each webshop page of the front-office. The header and the footer components remain the same as in 404 page, like in all other webshop front-office pages. But the middle components are the following:

* **The page you are looking for was not found** - by default in EN language, it is an H1 title, notifying about reaching the 404 page.
* **No products available yet** - by default EN language, it is an H4 title, notifying about the absence of the searched products.
* **Stay tuned! More products will be shown here as they are added.** - by default EN language, it is a paragraph title, which advises about the situation in products.
* **Search our catalog** - it is a search input field with a placeholder _Search our catalog_ and a magnifier glass material icon. Helps to search for certain items in webshop.
