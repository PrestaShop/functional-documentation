Pagination ([Pagination basic UI kit](https://build.prestashop-project.org/prestashop-ui-kit/?path=/story/pagination--basic)) is a sequence of pages which are connected and have similar content. When list is opened always shows first page.&#x20;

\
Clicking on number or arrow button allows to move through pages.&#x20;

\
When hover mouse pointer on button, its background color changes.&#x20;

\
By default PrestaShop displays 50 elements per page but user can choose other option. Lists can be displayed as 20, 50, 100, 300 and 1000 at one viewport screen.
