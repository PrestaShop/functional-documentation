# Color picker

## Description

This component is used for users, from the UI side, to choose a desired particular color for the targeted element.

## Component structure&#x20;

Near the Color input, there is a Color picker widget popup, marked with a different color-picker rounded icon.&#x20;

Once clicked, the popup will be prompted in the UI. The popup has the following components:

* **Main HTML color code input field** - for typing the HTML color code with the hashtag symbol (#).&#x20;
* **Colorized square** - area of all the color palette, once the mouse cursor is hovering in any place in the square, the cursor becomes a plus icon (+). Once clicked, the main Color input will be stored with the HTML color code and the input will be colorized with the particular selected color.
* **10 color previews** - 10 squares with different color previews for faster color choosing.
* **Popup Input field** - for typing the HTML color code with the hashtag symbol (#) in the popup.&#x20;

For example, _#ffffff_ value indicates white color. [Read more](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/) about the HTML color values.
